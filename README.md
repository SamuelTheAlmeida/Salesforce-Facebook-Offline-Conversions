# Salesforce Facebook Offline Conversions

This is a simple Salesforce Apex Batch to send data to the [Facebook Marketing API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/offline-conversions/)

The API receives offline events from Salesforce and check if it matches to an event on Facebook Ads platform. For an example, if you have a store, you can check the amount of online ad clicks that turned into sales.
